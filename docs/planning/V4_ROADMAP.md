## Open Questions

1. **Should we charge for premium features?**
   - Pro: Sustainability, resources for development
   - Con: Against current philosophy, barriers to entry
   - **Recommendation**: Keep free, consider donations

2. **Should AI insights require cloud account?**
   - Pro: Better data, personalized
   - Con: Privacy concerns, dependency
   - **Recommendation**: Client-side ML only, privacy-first

3. **Should we support other auth providers beyond Google?**
   - Options: GitHub, Apple, Email/Password
   - **Recommendation**: Start with Google, add others in v4.1

4. **How to handle users who don't want cloud features?**
   - **Recommendation**: Keep fully functional without sign-in

---

## Conclusion

v4.0 represents a **significant evolution** of highBeta from a local-first tool to a **cloud-enabled productivity platform** while maintaining the core philosophy and local-first capabilities.

**Recommended Scope**: Focus on **Core Features** (Authentication, Sync, Anti-Gaming, Accessibility) for v4.0 release. This provides maximum value with manageable risk.

**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks for v4.0 Core, then iterative releases (v4.1, v4.2) for additional features.

**Next Steps**:
1. Validate scope with stakeholders
2. Create detailed technical specs for Core Features
3. Set up Firebase project and development environment
4. Begin Phase 1: Authentication & Sync
