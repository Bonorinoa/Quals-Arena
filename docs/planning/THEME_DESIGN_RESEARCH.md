# Theme Design Research: Color Psychology & Neuroscience

## Scientific Foundation

Based on validated research in color psychology and neuroscience, this document outlines the scientific rationale for highBeta's theme system.

## Research Summary

### Blue Theme - "Calm" Focus
**Neuroscience Findings:**
- Stimulates parasympathetic nervous system
- Reduces blood pressure and heart rate
- Lowers stress-related cortisol levels
- Enhances sustained attention and cognitive performance

**Psychological Effects:**
- Trust and stability
- Calmness and relaxation
- Improved focus and concentration
- Enhanced clarity of thought
- Optimal for analytical work and deep focus

**Application in highBeta:**
The "Calm" theme uses blue and purple hues to create a meditative, low-arousal environment that promotes sustained focus and reduces cognitive stress.

### Purple Accents - Creative Empowerment
**Research Findings:**
- Associated with creativity and higher-level thinking
- Evokes "empowering emotions"
- Sits between cool calming and stimulating tones
- Supports creative problem-solving

**Psychological Effects:**
- Enhanced creativity
- Mystery and intrigue
- Empowerment
- Balance of focus and creative thinking

### Current Theme - "Founder" (Deep Ocean)
The existing deep ocean/dark academic aesthetic (teal/green accents) represents:
- Action and determination
- Growth and progress (green psychological associations)
- Professional focus
- High-performance mindset

## Theme Implementation Strategy

### Two-Theme System
1. **Founder Theme** (Current/Default)
   - Deep ocean blues (#0a1628, #162d4d)
   - Emerald green accents (#10b981)
   - Represents action, growth, determination
   - Optimal for: High-energy work sessions, building momentum

2. **Calm Theme** (New)
   - Deeper blue/purple palette
   - Lavender and indigo accents
   - Represents tranquility, sustained focus, meditation
   - Optimal for: Long study sessions, analytical work, stress reduction

### Design Principles
- Maintain consistent glass morphism effects
- Preserve depth and hierarchy
- Ensure accessibility (contrast ratios)
- Smooth transitions between themes
- Keep animation energy consistent with theme psychology

## Implementation Notes
- Use muted/softer tones for both themes (avoid oversaturation)
- Maintain WCAG AA contrast standards
- Test both themes under various lighting conditions
- Consider circadian timing (future enhancement: auto-switch based on time)
